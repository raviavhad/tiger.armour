**Problem Statement addressed (or explain your own): [ ]**

According to Gartner, **blockchain applications could generate up to $3.1 trillion in new company value by 2030**, with half of that value coming from **operational efficiency applications**. On the other side, the **blockchain is a source of concern**. If you're a tiny business that uses smart contracts, you never know who will call your code next. It could be a hacker seeking to exploit a flaw in your implementation, or it could be a little sketchy figure working for an unlawful organization or organized crime ring. You have no idea who you're dealing with until the code starts running, and to make matters worse, once the code starts running, there is no turning back. **Due to the immutability of the blockchain, you should always verify who you are dealing with before proceeding with an action**. Smart contracts are decentralized digital contracts that are executed automatically when predefined terms and circumstances are met.

**Description**: 

Presenting our solution TG ARmour which is a **managed security solution** driven by tiger graph that can be deployed on any blockchain. TG Armor necessitates a high level of integration with upstream and downstream data sources. To meet this demand, Tiger Graph has developed a series of connectors that enhance your existing analytics capabilities by improving your access to the capability of advanced analytics on connected data. The smart contract integrates with tiger graph, which is the world's quickest and only enterprise-grade graph database. The graph solution stores the graphs of known malicious users. These **users are ranked according to a risk score** that indicates the likelihood of encountering them.

The **smart contract integrates with tiger graph**, which is the world's quickest and only enterprise-grade graph database. The graph solution stores the graphs of known malicious users. These users are ranked according to a risk score that indicates the likelihood of encountering them.

For instance, if the user has a history of **denial-of-service attacks** or recently stole money from another contract, your contract can automatically refuse to engage with them and quickly fail the action. TG Armor adds a layer of security not only for developers, but also for users. We keep track of contracts that are running malware based on signatures and account information. 

We want to be as secure as possible, where contracts can state that I will engage with users who have established their identity with this trusted third party. In essence, we offer a scalable source of confidence to a trust-less environment.

The TG Armor **Data Visualization** connections empower users with enhanced insights on linked data, helping them to maximize the value of their existing investments. 
The solution for protecting smart contracts must be secure itself. Tiger Graph understands that we require not only performance but also safety and security.
Due to the fact that the fees for smart contract execution are determined by the transaction and the speed of execution, the API response time must be extremely fast in order to minimize costs and optimize performance. We obtain results quickly using tiger graph. Sub-second response time for queries involving the access and computation of tens of millions of entities and relationships. Our system takes advantage of parallelism at every level, from the storage engine to the high-level query language GSQL, to deliver industry-leading concurrency and performance. Financial institutions can expedite transformation, leverage the power of data to generate efficiencies, and enhance the client experience by leveraging the potential of collaborative innovation.

- Innovative use case of graph
The Decentralized Finance market, non-existent a few years ago, has now grown into an industry worth hundreds of billions, and tens of billions of dollars worth of crypto has flowed through DeFi applications and it's growing every day. TG Armour Innovates the way smart contracts will be written and executed. Our solution implements implements modules which are easy to use and cloud agnostic hence building a solution suitable for any blockchain.

- Ambitious and complex graph
We want to be as secure as possible, where contracts can state that I will engage with users who have established their identity with this trusted third party. In essence, we offer a scalable source of confidence to a trust-less environment.
